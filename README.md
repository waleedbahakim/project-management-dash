2. **Progressive Disclosure**: Complex features revealed gradually
3. **Consistency**: Predictable patterns throughout the interface
4. **Feedback**: Clear response to all user actions
5. **Forgiving Design**: Easy error recovery and undo functionality
6. **Accessibility**: Ensuring usability for all users
